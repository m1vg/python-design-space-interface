# Design Space Example 2
##########################
# This example is similar to the previous example, but demonstrates more
# advanced functions of the Design Space Toolbox.

# This example has been created from the original examples for the matlab 
# version of the design space toolbox, written by Rick Fasani.

## Import package with basic functionality
# The initial step in running the design space toolbox is importing the base
# package, and in this case the plotting functionality.
#
# Importing the plotting utilities subpackage adds plotting functions to objects
# object that are often of interest. We must also import the plotting library,
# and w make plotting interactive.


import dspace
import dspace.plotutils
from math import *
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
matplotlib.interactive(True)


## Enter Equations
# The following system is similar to the previous example, but with
# multiple negative terms.  It still has two dependent variables and two
# independent variables, and the design space will vary over the two
# independent variables X3 and X4.
#
# dX1/dt =     10*X1*X2*X3*X4 + X1*X2 -     10*X1*X3*X4^-1 - X1
# dX1/dt = (1/10)*X1*X2*X3*X4 + X1*X2 - (1/10)*X2*X3*X4^-1 - X2
#
# Each equations in string format is entered forming a list of equations, where
# the left hand side of each equation is indicated by either the 
# time-differentiated variable using dot notation for differentiation, or zero
# for constraint equations.  An example of a algebraic constraint is shown for
# the system above.
#
# dX1/dt =     10*X5 + X1*X2 -     10*X1*X3*X4^-1 - X1
# dX1/dt = (1/10)*X5 + X1*X2 - (1/10)*X2*X3*X4^-1 - X2
#      X5 = X1*X2*X3*X4
#

f = ['X1. =     alpha*X5 + X1*X2 -     alpha*X1*X3*X4^-1 - X1',
     'X2. = (1/alpha)*X5 + X1*X2 - (1/alpha)*X2*X3*X4^-1 - X2',
     '  X5 = X1*X2*X3*X4']
 
# The next step is to construct an Equations object using this list of strings
# and specifying which variables are auxiliary and thus dependent. These are 
# specified by a list of variables names passed by the 'auxiliary_variables'
# keyword argument.

eq = dspace.Equations(f, auxiliary_variables=['X5'])

## Construct the System Design Space
# The previous system of equations can be analyzed using system design space.
# To construct the design space, we use an Equations object specifying our 
# system.

ds = dspace.DesignSpace(eq)

## Test for Validity
# We choose X3 and X4 as are axes for a 2D plot, and must specify a value for
# alpha. We obtain the list of valid cases with a slice through design space
# with alpha = 10, 1e-3 < X3 < 1e3 and 1e-3 < X4 < 1e3. 
 
valid_cases = ds.valid_cases(p_bounds={'alpha':10, 
                                       'X3':[1e-3, 1e3],
                                       'X4':[1e-3, 1e3]})

print ('All valid cases in slice: ' + str(valid_cases))

## Plot
# We define a nominal point in parameter space.  
# The value of the individual variables at this point will not affect the plots.
# We obtain the list of parameters and independent variables from the design 
# space object.

ivar_names = ds.independent_variables

# We define a variable pool that holds symbols for all the independent variables
# and parameters of the system, by passing these names to the construction of
# the object.

pvals = dspace.VariablePool(names=ivar_names)
pvals['alpha'] = 10
pvals['X3'] = 1  # Will be a variable on an axis, value wont be affect plot
pvals['X4'] = 1  # Will be a variable on an axis, value wont be affect plot

## Global color scheme for use across multiple slices.
# In this example we will plot many different slices of the same dsign space.
# To get consistent colors for the different regions, we will use a global color
# scheme with all the valid cases included.

all_valid_cases = ds.valid_cases()
colors = dict()
for i in range(0, len(all_valid_cases)):
    colors[str(all_valid_cases[i])] = matplotlib.cm.hsv(float(i)/len(all_valid_cases))

temp = colors['6']
colors['6'] = colors['11']
colors['11'] = temp
##
# We make the design space object plot a 2D slice with a specified x and
# y axis and a reference parameter set. To make the colors consistent across 
# the figures we have included the colors from the previous plot by passing a 
# color dictionary to the 'color_dict' keyword argument in the drawing method.

# upper bounds, respectively, on the parameters, X3 and X4 (in Cartesian 
# coordinates).

# A bounding box can be obtained with specific constraints on the parameters,
# by passing parameter values or parameter ranges.

y_vertices = [min(box['X4']), max(box['X4']), max(box['X4']), min(box['X4'])]

## Measure Tolerance
# An operating point is set such that it is in case 4.

pvals['X3'] = 2
pvals['X4'] = 1

# The tolerance from this
# point to the boundaries of the region is measured for each orthogonal 
# direction.  The result is given as fold change down and fold change up,
# respecively (in Cartesian coordinates).
