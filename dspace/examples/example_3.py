# Design Space Example 3
##########################
# This example demonstrates how the Design Space Toolbox handles
# intersecting, or overlapping, cases, which can indicate the potential
# for hysteresis.

# This example has been created from the original examples for the matlab 
# version of the design space toolbox, written by Rick Fasani.

## Import package with basic functionality
# The initial step in running the design space toolbox is importing the base
# package, and in this case the plotting functionality.
#
# Importing the plotting utilities subpackage adds plotting functions to objects
# object that are often of interest. We must also import the plotting library,
# and we make plotting interactive.

import dspace
import dspace.plotutils
from math import *
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
matplotlib.interactive(True)

## Enter Equations
# The following system has two dependent variables and two independent
# variables.  Ultimately, the design space will vary over the two
# independent variables X3 and X4.
#
#   dX1/dt = 1000*X1^2*X2^-1 + 1000*X2^-1 - X1*X3*X4
#   dX2/dt = X1^2 + 10000 - X2
#
# The equations and dependent variables are entered as strings.

f = ['X1. = 1000*X1^2*X2^-1 + 100*X2^-1 - X1*X3*X4',
     'X2. =      X1^2 + 1000 - X2']
# The next step is to construct an Equations object using this list of strings
# and specifying which variables are auxiliary and thus dependent. These are 
# specified by a list of variables names passed by the 'auxiliary_variables'
# keyword argument.

eq = dspace.Equations(f)

## Construct the System Design Space
# The previous system of equations can be analyzed using system design space.
# To construct the design space, we use an Equations object specifying our 
# system.

ds = dspace.DesignSpace(eq)

## Test for Validity
# Cases are checked to see if they are valid and the dominant terms are
# printed for each valid case.
 
valid_cases = ds.valid_cases()
cases = ds(valid_cases)
print ('Valid Cases:')
for i in cases:
    print (str(i.case_number) + ':' + i.signature)

## Parameter set
# We define a nominal point in parameter space.  
# The value of the individual variables at this point will not affect the plots.
# We obtain the list of parameters and independent variables from the design 
# space object.

ivar_names = ds.independent_variables

# We define a variable pool that holds symbols for all the independent variables
# and parameters of the system, by passing these names to the construction of
# the object.

pvals = dspace.VariablePool(names=ivar_names)
## pvals['alpha'] = 10
pvals['X3'] = 1  # Will be a variable on an axis, value wont be affect plot
pvals['X4'] = 1  # Will be a variable on an axis, value wont be affect plot

## Search for Intersections
# Under certain conditions, the design space can be exhaustively searched
# for all occurances of intersecting cases.  Occurances of three
# intersecting cases are especially interesting--they indicate the
# potential for bi-stability and hysteresis.  Here, the one occurance of three 
# intersecting cases (1, 2, and 4) is obtained.

intersections = ds.intersecting_cases(3, ds.valid_cases())
print (intersections)

##
# We make the design space object plot a 2D slice with a specified x and
# y axis and a reference parameter set. The default behavior of the plotting
# functions calculate all intersecting cases of up to 5 regions.

# Interesections of more or less cases, or specific intersections, can be draw
# by using the 'intersections' keyword argument, which receives a list of
# numbers indicating the intersecting regions that will be drawn.
