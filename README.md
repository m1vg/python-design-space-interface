Python Package of the Design Space Toolbox 
==============================================


Getting Started
---------------------

The most convenient way to access the software is through its Docker Image: https://hub.docker.com/r/savageau/dst3.


Examples of System Analysis Using the Design Space Toolbox
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Design Space Toolbox Python Package is a standard Python package that includes Python code and a Python-C bridge extension. The current version of the package lacks documentation; however, there are examples available that highlight the array of objects and methods for the analysis of non-linear systems.

These examples are found in the Docker Image under /Tutorials and /Supporting_Notebooks.
